# DCGAN-for-Digit-Generation-from-MNIST
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using TensorFlow to generate handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset. The generator learns to produce realistic digits, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake digits. Training uses a custom loss function and visualizes learning curves
